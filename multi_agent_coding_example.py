AutoGen Multi-Agent Coding Example

This example demonstrates a collaborative coding workflow with four specialized agents:
üß† CodeAssistant - Generates Python code
üßê CriticAgent - Reviews and suggests improvements  
üß™ TestAgent - Writes tests to validate the code
üôã UserProxyAgent - Initiates tasks and manages the workflow
